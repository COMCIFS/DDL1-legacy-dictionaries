# DDL1-legacy-dictionaries
This repository is for management of deprecated DDL1 dictionaries during their phasing out. The canonical versions at the IUCr are periodically updated from this repository.

Note that no new activity should rely on the contents of these dictionaries. All DDL1 dictionaries are deprecated and users and implementers of CIF tools should always refer to either DDL2 or DDLm dictionaries. For more information, see [the IUCr site](http://www.iucr.org/resource/cif/ddl).
